> Riverine exports of silicon (Si) directly influence global carbon (C)
> cycling through the growth of diatoms, ubiquitous autotrophs in marine
> and freshwater systems, which account for \~25% of global primary
> production. Rivers play essential roles in processing and supplying
> the Si necessary for diatom growth, but we have limited knowledge of
> the controls on river Si exports, especially how they vary across
> biomes. Prior work has shown conflicting importance of various
> drivers, such as lithology, riverine productivity, and terrestrial
> vegetation in controlling river Si exports. Capturing a baseline
> understanding of how these factors influence Si exports across biomes
> is essential for understanding freshwater and marine C cycles,
> especially during this period of rapid climatic warming. This
> synthesis will answer three specific research questions related to the
> roles of 1) terrestrial vegetation, 2) river productivity and 3)
> climate warming in controlling river Si exports across biomes. Our
> proposed sites span the globe (e.g., Antarctic, tropical, temperate,
> boreal, alpine, Arctic systems), and present a unique cross-network
> opportunity to connect LTER-based research with that of the Critical
> Zone Observatory and USGS. Together, we will create the first
> data-driven predictive framework of how riverine Si exports will
> respond to global change.
